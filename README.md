# ai-governance-security-dashboard
A demonstration dashboard showcasing AI governance maturity, public sector AI readiness vs. responsibility, fairness and bias assessments, and adversarial AI risks — aligned with NIST AI RMF, Microsoft AI Strategy Roadmap, and current literature on public sector AI governance gaps.

# AI Governance and Security Dashboard for Public Sector AI Systems

A demonstration dashboard showcasing:

✅ AI Governance Maturity (based on Microsoft AI Strategy Roadmap)  
✅ Public Sector AI Readiness vs. Responsibility (based on AI Readiness Index analysis)  
✅ Bias & Fairness assessment for AI-enabled public services (Fairlearn)  
✅ Adversarial AI Threat Modeling and Example LLM Prompt Injection (based on MLSecOps concepts)

### Goals
- Demonstrate practical alignment with NIST AI RMF, Microsoft AI Governance Maturity, and adversarial AI security best practices.
- Complement existing work on explainability and risk assessment (xai-ai-risk-dashboard).
- Apply insights from current AI governance research to practical tooling.

### Project Structure
- `data/` — Sample datasets used
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for fairness evaluation and governance readiness modeling
- `src/` — Streamlit/Dash-based interactive dashboard
- `adversarial_demo/` — Simple LLM prompt injection + adversarial testing examples
